<p>* 1. Check your phone for the Speaker Cleaner feature!<br>
Some Android phone skins have a dedicated feature to remove foreign particles from the phone speaker when it doesn't sound good. The feature blasts high<br>
-pitched sound at the loudest<br>
 volume to remove water, dust, and other foreign particles from your phone speaker.<br>

 * So, before you try any other solution in this article, kindly check your phone for such a feature. It could surface as “Speaker Cleaner”, “Clear Speaker”, <br>
or whatever your OEM calls it under the sound or additional settings.<br>

* For instance, the feature exists as "Clear Speaker" on some phones running MiUI software. You can visit Settings → Additional Settings → Clear Speaker and <br>
follow the on-screen instructions to clean water from the phone speaker.<br>

* 2. Download an app to get water out of phone speaker and ear speaker<br>
* If your phone doesn’t have the Speaker Cleaner feature, you can still play a high-pitched sound to eject the water from your phone speaker. However, playing<br>
 songs from your library anyhow won't pull any trigger.<br>
 There are sounds made specifically to clean water from phone speakers, and that’s what you need.<br>

 * And speaking of that, you don’t need to wander around looking for those audio files, as you can use an app to get water out of phone speaker and earpiece. <br>
There are many of those apps on the Play Store that carries the “Speaker Cleaner” title, and they work like charm.<br>

* Like the native "Speaker Cleaner" feature on phones, these apps play a loud, vibrating sound that gets water out of phone speaker.<br>

* Here’s how to remove water from a mobile speaker with an app:<br>

* Install and launch the “Speaker Cleaner - Remove Water, Dust & Boost Sound” app from the Play Store.  <br>
Disconnect from your Bluetooth speaker or earbuds if you’re using any of them.<br>
Increase your phone volume to the maximum<br>
* In the app, make sure the switch is set to ( You can switch to Ear Speaker to get water out of ear speaker after)<br>
Now, hit the “Start Cleaning” button and position the phone in a way that the speaker is facing down.<br>
It may take up to a minute or more before it completes the process. Once completed, try playing a song to see if your phone speaker sounds well now. Otherwise,<br> repeat the process two or three times. You can even change the sound mode<br>

* 3. Let the water dry out
Sincerely speaking, blasting high-pitched sound to get water out of the phone speaker would only work in some cases (maybe if the water didn't go deep inside the<br> speaker). In most cases, what works is leaving the phone somewhere to dry completely.<br>

* You can leave the phone under room temperature for several hours (usually 24hrs at max) to dry out. Just ensure you place the phone in such a way that the affected speaker is facing down.<br>

* Alternatively, you can bury your phone in uncooked rice for at least 24 hours. Doing so is effective to drain water from the phone speaker because the nature of rice <br>is to suck in every liquid/moist around it.<br>

* Still no luck? Fix your water-damaged phone.
