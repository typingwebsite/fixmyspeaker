    <h2>1.Disconnect and power down</h2><bR>
        If your earbuds are wired, disconnect them from your Android or iPhone. If they’re wireless earbuds, turn them off.<bR> This usually involves holding down one of the buttons for several seconds. Double-check the manual to be sure;<bR> just because they’re disconnected from your phone doesn’t mean they’re powered off.<bR>
        
            <h2>2. Remove and clean the tips</h2>
        Carefully remove the silicone or foam ear tips. These should slide off fairly easily. You can use a dry cotton swab,<bR> aka a Q-tip, to remove any earwax buildup. A dilute mixture of dish soap and water can help if you haven’t cleaned <bR>your buds in a while.<bR>
        
        It’s important to clean the ear tips separately from the earbuds, so none of what you’re cleaning off gets jammed into<bR> the earbud’s holes. Once cleaned, let the ear tips dry completely before you put them back on the earbuds.<bR>
        
        <h2>3.Clean the earbuds</h2>
        Even if your earbuds are water resistant, treat them like they aren’t when you’re cleaning. For example, don’t use high<bR> pressure water, even from the tap. It could force its way into places it shouldn’t, ruining your earbuds in <bR>the process. Also, don’t let them soak for the same reason.<bR>
        
        One of the main areas you’ll need to clean is the mesh screen that covers the earbud’s sound-producing drivers. Any gunk<bR> or grime buildup here can diminish the sound quality. You can use a clean, soft toothbrush to gently remove <bR>any visible earwax or dirt. <bR>
        
        A cotton swab dampened with isopropyl alcohol, aka rubbing alcohol, will work, too, but don’t use too much. We say damp,<bR> not wet, as you don’t want the alcohol to get inside the earbuds. Don’t use anything stronger, like bleach or<bR> other household cleaning agents, since these could damage the earbuds, too.<bR>
        
        Whatever method you chose, clean with the speaker mesh facing down, so anything you remove falls out, not further in. Also<bR> double-check that any charging ports are closed any time the earbuds are near liquid.

        <h2>4. Clean the charging case</h2>
If your earbuds come with a charging case, you should always use it. However, that means it can get dirty too.<bR>

For wired headphones, cleaning the case can be as easy as wiping it out with a microfiber cloth. For wireless headphones, <bR>it’s important to find the delicate charging pin connectors. If you’re not careful to keep these clean, your headphones<bR> may not charge properly or at all. You don’t want to get them wet, though.<bR> Your headphones may be waterproof, but the charging case may not be. <bR>

Using a similar method as for the earbuds themselves, lightly dampen a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol to clean the charging <bR>pins. Make sure the charging case is completely dry before you put the earbuds back in.<bR>

<h2>How to keep your earbuds clean</h2>
The easiest way to keep your Airpods or other earbuds clean is to wipe them down after every use and store them in their case. <bR>This is especially true for earbuds used at the gym, while exercising, or during any other sweaty activities.<bR> For non-workout earbuds, you can probably get away with wiping them down every<bR> few days, or maybe just once a week. Use microfiber, or another lint-free and dry cloth.<bR>

Don’t put your earbuds back in their case if they’re damp. If you regularly toss them into a gym bag with your other workout<bR> clothes, consider using a desiccant silica gel. The gel will absorb the moisture in the bag. You could place the<bR> silica gel and your earbuds together in a ziplock bag.<bR>

As with anything, it’s also worth checking any instructions included with your headphones, or on the manufacturer’s website,<bR> for specific cleaning instructions for your headphone model.<bR>
